CodingQuiz!

This is a small php project that is akin to codingbat, written in php, js, html and css. 

The project is up at https://web.njit.edu/~aem39/

It took 3 months to design, implement and test this project, and it has these main test cases:

A professor can login using the credentials "professor" and "password" (no quotations) and they can enter a python question, and make an exam by selecting questions in the question bank

A student can login using using the credentials "student" and "password" (no quotations) and they can take an exam that the professor created, and submit it for grading. 

The program will automatically grade the python code that the student submitted, and the professor can edit the points and add comments as necessary

This has been one of my favorite projects that I have done because it was done in agile and my first Php and Javascript project
